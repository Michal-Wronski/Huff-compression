The included files were created to verify formulas using point compression on Huff's and general Huff's curves. The all of presented files have been written in Magma.


The repository includes the following files:

- Huff_isogeny_correctness_checking.magma, which proves that presented formulas for isogenous curve computation and point evaluation (also using point compression f(P)=xy) on Huff's curve are correct.

- General_Huff_isogeny_correctness_checking.magma, which proves that presented formulas for isogenous curve computation and point evaluation (also using point compression f(P)=xy) on general Huff's curve are correct.

- Huff_diff_add_doub_rec_correctness_checking.magma, which proves that formulas for differential addition, doubling and point recovery on Huff's curve using compression function f(P)=xy are correct.

- General_Huff_diff_add_doub_rec_correctness_checking.magma, which proves that formulas for differential addition, doubling and point recovery on general Huff's curve using compression function f(P)=xy are correct.
